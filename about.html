 <p>The purpose of this edition and translation project is to make the poem <em>Huon d’Auvergne</em> available in its multiple versions to a range of scholars, students, critics and linguists in a searchable, verifiable and easily read open-access digital format by the end of the three-year grant.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Leslie Zarker Morgan</strong> is leader of a team of fellow scholars who have been awarded an NEH Translation and Scholarly Editions grant of $200,000 for a translation and editing project. This three-year project (January 2014-December 2016) funds a digital edition and modern English translation of the last unedited Franco-Italian epic, <em>Huon d’Auvergne</em>, drawing on three manuscripts and one fragment, dating from 1341 to 1441.</p>
