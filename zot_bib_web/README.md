Zot/Bib/Web
A program to export Zotero bibliographies to interactive HTML
===========

This tool generates interactive web bibliographies based on one or
more collections in a Zotero repository.

Collections can be maintained by groups of people, using Zotero's web
interface or their desktop applications.


Bibliographies
-  are grouped by collection
-  editable in Zotero by one or more users
-  are interactively searchable
-  linked to PDF documents or other URLs
-  have BibTeX records
-  and can be exported to HTML or pushed to a Wordpress database

The content generated is static.  This program is meant to 
be run regularly. 

Zot/bib/web is available on Github.


Example Installations
----------------------------------------

http://acs.ist.psu.edu/wp/pub/
http://david-reitter.com/pub/


Requirements
----------------------------------------
- Python 2.7 installation (Python 3 not yet supported by Pyzotero)
- Pyzotero
- Bibliographic entries in Zotero (as user or as group)


Setup
-----------------------------------------

- Install Pyzotero, a library for python:
  sudo pip install pyzotero
or:
  sudo easy_install pyzotero

- In a new file called settings.py, add configuration as documented.
  See settings_example.py for an example. 
  Go to zotero.org to get your API secret key.

- Upload jquery.js to your server (or find it).

- ensure zot.py is executable (chmod ug+x zot.py)

To generate HTML and include it in a website:

-  run zot.py once/on demand, or install as cron job or service on a server
Do not run it more than once a day.  Configure it directly in zot.py,
or in a separate file settings.py to make upgrading simple.

- include the resulting file zotero-bib.html (or as configured) in
  your website as you see fit.  You may also include individual
  collection files, which are also generated.   You can configure
  zot.py to generate a complete HTML document, or just a portion of it.
  
- Style your bibliography using CSS.  An example style
  file is included.


Bibliography
-----------------------------------------

- With Zotero, create a bibliography and note its ID (e.g., from the
  URL in the Zotero web interface).  Example: "MGID90AT".
  This ID is what you need for the "toplevelfilter" variable in
  settings.py.

- You can and should add sub-collections to your bibliography.

- To define an order for the sub-collections, name them starting with
  a number: "10 Journal Articles".

- To cause zot_bib_web to format a sub-collection in "short" mode, add
  a * at the beginning of the collection name: "05* Selected Works".
  This sub-collection will be shown using titles and years only, which
  can then be expanded.
  You may want to copy bibliographic items from other parts of the
  bibliography into this sub-collection.

Here's an example of a bibliography structure:

    My Publications [MGID90AT]
		10* Selected Works
		15 In Preparation / Under Review
		20 Refereed Works by Topic
			Semantics
			Parsing
			Dialogue
			Machine Learning
		30 Theses
		40 Talks (Without Paper)

Set toplevelfilter and catchallcollection to MGID90AT in settings.py.



Wordpress Support
-----------------------------------------

This package can push directly to a Wordpress site.  A separate
program "push.py" is included to do this.

Follow these steps:

1.  Set up zot.py to generate a bibliography you like.
    Call zot.py --full to generate a complete zotero-bib.html file
    for debugging purposes.  Configure settings.py to not generate
    the full HTML code.
2.  Create a WP page or a post for the bibliography. Insert
    [zot_bib_web COLLECTION] where you'd like the bibliography
    inserted.  Replace COLLECTION with the ID of the collection.
	(More options: see push.py)
3.  Configure push.py (at the top).  You will need to know a few simple
    details about your WP installation.
4.  Run push.py regularly or on demand.  It will call zot.py
    automatically and then update the page in WP.



How it works
-----------------------------------------

Zot.py produces annotated, beautiful bibliographies for the web from a
Zotero collection.  It is designed for individuals and for research
groups.

This program will load settings.py for its configuration.
It will retrieve all publications for the given user or
group.  If subcollections are present, each subcollection will form a
separate section.  The top-level collection can be ignored (depending
on configuration.)

The output of zot.py consists of HTML: either a full document, or a snippet, as
configured.

Each bibliographic entry is annotated with a bib record and an abstract,
each of which can be revealed by the reader (client-side javascript).
