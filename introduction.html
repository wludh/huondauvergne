                       <p>Huon d’Auvergne [Hugh of or from Alvernia] belongs linguistically and thematically to both Italian and French literary history. An exemplar of <em>chanson de geste</em>, initially an Old French epic form, Huon was appreciated by princes in the northern Italian peninsula, and incorporated into Italian tradition when the Florentine Andrea da Barberino produced his version in Italian prose in the 15<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p>Huon d'Auvergne is the only Franco-Italian text never to have been edited in its entirety. The three major versions, in manuscripts dating from 1341 to 1441, span a linguistic range from almost Old French to almost Italian with some French expressions. We will produce a parallel digital edition of the entire tradition (a synoptic edition) and a translation into English during the period of this grant (January 2014-January 2017). Having the entire corpus online will render more exact study possible, with the entire range of the Huon texts accessible and searchable.</p>

<p>The text’s importance linguistically as a chronological demonstration, through multiple dated exemplars, of the development of literary language, is equaled by the significance of its narrative content and its historical context. The language mix and considerable length of the manuscripts has inhibited comprehensive study of Huon. Examination of the hybrid language itself dominates much of the limited scholarship published to date. Yet the narrative includes many themes of interest to scholars and students both of literature and of other disciplines: a descent into hell that may represent the first incorporation of Dante’s Inferno, Old French epic characters, elements of Alexander the Great romances, and borrowings from travelogues (e.g., Prester John). Moreover, Huon exhibits textual play, like subtle mockery of the hero’s deeds, making his chivalric diligence and religious devotion sources of understated fun through exaggeration and overemphasis, aided by secondary characters who witness both his constancy and naïveté. Historically, the era 1341-1441 evokes humanism, with debates about the role of princes and church that Huon d’Auvergne illustrates through narrative for its aristocratic public.</p>

<p>Huon d'Auvergne is a story of truth, travels, and faith. All versions contain three central episodes that include Huon, the protagonist, and his wife, Ynide, at Charles Martel’s court, and Huon’s travels. Charles Martel holds court in Paris. The women form a procession to honor the saints, where Charles sees and falls in love with Ynide. He approaches her, but she refuses his pleas for her love. Charles Martel is miserable, and plots with Saudin, his court singer, to get Huon away from Ynide: Charles convenes Huon to complain that all rulers obey him and send tribute except Lucifer. Huon must therefore go to hell to obtain tribute from Lucifer. Huon returns to Auvergne with his family and retainers, then prepares to depart for hell. He leaves Ynide’s brothers in charge of his goods, his land of Auvergne, and his wife.
Huon’s voyage is divided into two segments, before and after Ynide’s defense of Auvergne and herself from Charles Martel. Huon initially travels through various recognizably-named Mediterranean lands seeking the entrance to hell. While Huon wanders, the action turns to Ynide in Auvergne. Charles Martel sends an embassy to Ynide. She refuses the offer and sends the messenger(s) packing. The narrator returns to Huon, who travels now through various marvelous lands, where he encounters supernatural creatures. He finally enters hell with the aid of a devil, Aeneas, and Guillaume d’Orange (William of Orange). After a tour of hell, Huon receives Lucifer’s tribute that he takes back to Charles Martel. When Charles Martel receives Lucifer's tribute, devils carry him off to hell.
